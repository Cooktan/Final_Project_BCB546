# Final_Project_BCB546
## Authors:Juan Panelo, Kevin Chiteri, Sean Mclaughlin, Yu-Ru Chen, and Tanner Cook
## Group name Geneiotic Breeder's
## Authors' description: Graduate Students at Iowa State University studying plant sciences with an emphasis on plant breeding, genetics, and meiosis.

### General description: This repository contains information for the final project in BCB546X 




### Goal:
	The goal of this project was to try and recreate the figures published in, "Defining the developmental program leading to meiosis in maize", by Nelms and Walbot(2019).
	Our group attempted to recreate many of the figures presented in this paper with various levels of success.

### Sources of data:

	* Transcript read data: Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE121039)
	* Supplementary figures for S1-S7 (https://science.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2019/04/03/364.6435.52.DC1)
		-These figures contain a variety of information such as sample info, genes with roles in the cell-cycle, DEGS, meiotic genes, gene ontology, etc.
	* Original Paper (DOI: 10.1126/science.aav6428)


	The analyses completed in this class were done with data and code found in this repository. All scipt information can be found in the R Markdown file and should be able to run through in its entirety.
		This analysis was done on R version 4.0.5


### Info on R markdown file
	The R markdown file contains script as well as descriptions of functions and files used.

	The outline of the R markdown file is organized by figure from the Nelms et al.(2019) paper as well as function in the script. 
	Most questions about functionality can be answered before the start of each code chunk within the R Markdown.
	The dependent packages are listed at the beginning of the R Markdown file with their respective versions.
